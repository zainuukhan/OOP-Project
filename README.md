# Helping-Hand Management System
Assigned Project to make Helping-Hand Management System
<br>
The "Helping Hand Project" is a Python program with a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) designed to connect users with service providers. It manages classes like ServiceProvider and User, maintaining a list of service providers and allowing users to input their details and select services. The GUI prompts users to enter personal information and choose desired services, displaying matching providers. Users can review and confirm their selections or modify choices before finalizing. The program includes error handling, service validation, and the ability to exit the selection process. To improve, future versions could incorporate persistent storage and enhanced error handling.
